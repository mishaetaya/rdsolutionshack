		<h2>The Hackathon will focus on the below three topics</h2>
		<h3>You can only choose one topic to work </h3>
		
		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_1">
			</div>
			<h3>Awareness in the Academic Community</h3>
			<p>Help us drastically increase awareness of Elsevier R&D tools in the Academic community.  We are on a journey to improve how research is done, but the first step is getting the word out.  <br> <br><br><br>

			<span style="font-weight:bold">	What would you do to make sure every professor, student and researcher knows who we are, what we do and thinks of us first when they need research help?</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_2">
			</div>
			<h3>Safety Challenges in the Chemicals Industry</h3>
			<p>Build the next generation Big Data solution for the Chemicals industry.  Our product and markting teams have spent several months speaking with Chemicals executives, scientists and engineers to identify their biggest pain points.  Now, we need to take what we learned and solve for those challenges. <br> <br> 

			<span style="font-weight:bold"> Can you prototype a user experience that addresses the Chemicals companies Big Data challenges?</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_3">
			</div>
			<h3>Scientific Information for the Internet of Things</h3>
			<p>Inter of Things is the latest buzz ... so much as Big Data is getting jealous.  Elsevier is the biggest scientific publisher of data across many disciplines, and we have databases of data easily accessibly API's, and it can have a huge impact on how real world data is interpreted <br> <br>

			<span style="font-weight:bold"> Can you define a use case for scientific data, and prototype a user experience for a customer in either the Chemicals, Pharma or Oil & Gas industry?</span></p>
