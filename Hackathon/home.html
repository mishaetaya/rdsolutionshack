		<h2>The Hackathon will focus on the below four topics</h2>
		<h3>Choose one topic </h3>
		
		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_1">
			</div>
			<h3>Awareness in the Academic Community</h3>
			<p>Help us drastically increase awareness of Elsevier R&D tools in the Academic community.  We are on a journey to improve how research is done, but the first step is getting the word out.  <br> <br>

			<span style="font-weight:bold">	What would you do to make sure every professor, student and researcher knows who we are, what we do and thinks of us first when they need research help?</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_2">
			</div>
			<h3>Attracting the best talent in a tech savvy world</h3> 
			<p>We're doing a lot of cutting edge work at Elsevier on topics of Big Data, Drug Discovery, Natural Language Processing, Data Mapping and many more topics. Problem is...not enough people know this. <br> <br> 

			<span style="font-weight:bold"> Can you create a viral marketing campaign to jump start awareness in the millenial community or a tool that helps us engage young technologists, marketers and product developers in a unique and fun way?</span></p>
		</div>

		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_3">
			</div>
			<h3>Scientific Information for the Internet of Things</h3>
			<p>Internet of Things is the latest buzz ... even Big Data is getting jealous.  Elsevier is the biggest scientific publisher of data across many disciplines, and we have databases of data easily accessibly API's, and it can have a huge impact on how real world data is interpreted <br> <br>

			<span style="font-weight:bold"> Can you define a use case for scientific data, and prototype a user experience for a customer in either the Chemicals, Pharma or Oil & Gas industry?</span></p>


		</div>

		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topicSelection_4">
			</div>
			<h3>Social Media in Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
			<p>Drug safety is a priority use case for Elsevier - we help Pharma companies monitor adverse events of drugs in published literature.  However social media presents a much bigger pool of data that Pharma companies haven't learned how to deal with yet. <br> <br>

			<span style="font-weight:bold"> Can you define a use case for how pharmaceutical companies might use social media data to monitor drug safety, and prototype a quick app?</span></p>
